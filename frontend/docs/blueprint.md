# **App Name**: CPython Memory Insights

## Core Features:

- Benchmark Trend Visualization: Display benchmark trends over time, filtering by version, binary flags, and benchmark name.
- Diff Table View: Show commit-to-commit comparisons in a table, highlighting metric deltas with color-coding.
- Data Upload and Management: Enable authenticated upload of new benchmark results, including schema validation and error reporting.
- Version and Binary Filtering: Allow filtering by exact versions, partial versions, or named branches, as well as arbitrary flag combinations.
- Commit Info Hover: Display commit information (timestamp, message, author) on hover in the diff table.
- Root Cause Analysis Assistant: Use an AI tool to suggest probable causes based on common performance regressions of particular python versions and flag sets

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#4B0082) to represent stability and depth in performance analysis.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), a neutral backdrop that keeps focus on benchmark data.
- Accent color: Gold (#FFD700) to highlight important changes and interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short amounts of body text; body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for displaying code snippets and commit SHAs.
- Use clear, technical icons to represent different benchmark metrics and actions.
- Design the diff table to mirror the layout of speed.python.org, ensuring horizontal and vertical scrolling is smooth with no performance issues.
